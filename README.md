# Holy-Rotation-WoW

This project was written in c++ just as a fun simple project. Can a machine learning algorithm figure out how to do a proper dps rotation as a holy paladin? The files included have the genetic algorith header and source files, along with the neural network header and sources as well. Simply add the files and then run, the dependencies are low so it should work on most machines. 

The text output will show which generation (or epoch) the machine is in followed by the max dps for that generation and the average of all agents in that generation. What you should see is that average dps increase higher and higher for each generation. This means that the neural network is learning how to dps as a holy paladin.

So why holy? Isn't holy supposed to heal? Yep but the cool thing with machine learning is to give it sub optimal situations and watch as it optimizes it's circumstance. So I could take healing specs and watch as they do max dps.
